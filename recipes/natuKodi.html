    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Natu Kodi Kura is a popular country chicken curry recipe that is part of Andhra cuisine. Natu Kodi, meaning country chicken is a rich gravy made with different spices. The typical village-style recipe is cooked on a wood fire in mud pots. All the ingredients are mixed and slow-cooked to perfection for a delicious, smoky flavour.
        Natu Kodi is enjoyed with minapa garelu, also known as medu vada. However, you can also have it with rice or roti as well. For that authentic taste, it’s important to use country chicken and not broiler chicken. For this recipe, you can choose to cut the chicken either into small pieces or larger-sized pieces.</p>
